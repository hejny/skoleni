Redesign the entire website as different concept:

We are trying experiment to test totally unconventional approach to web design. Entire page is the presented persona which is AI based.
User doesnt interact in the menus, articles, etc. but with the persona itself. **The persona is the website.**


- Keep using `ChatWithMe` and `@promptbook/components` as the base technology.
- It still has neccesary elements like footer *(maybe not the footer itself but the neccesary info)*, SEO, meta tags, etc. (everything that is neccesary for the page to be great website).
- Its full page, not just one component.
- It must be responsive and work on desktop, tablet and mobile.
- The persona is the main element of the page. It should be visually totally dominant.
- The page should work as a landing page for the freelancer who is offering workshop for companies to learn how to intergrate AI into their workflow.
- The persona should be able to answer questions about the workshop, the content, the pricing, etc. (you are now not doing the AI persona, just the design around it, responsibility of the persona is for another task delegated to `@promptbook`).
